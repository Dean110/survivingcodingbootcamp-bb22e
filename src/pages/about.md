I'm **Benjamin Williams**, a software developer from Columbus, Ohio. After stints as a musician and chef, I finally became a software developer.  Before I got to this point I had studied almost three years towards a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree that didn't really help when I realized a career change was needed in my life.  So looking at starting over for a four year journey getting a Computer Science degree wasn't an attractive option. After listening to ads for software development boot camps on NPR, I did further research and decided to try taking 14 weeks instead of 4 years to get into software development as a career.  After a stint at in the banking industry, I came back to We Can Code IT to take a role as a Software Development Instructor.

I treat software development as a professional trade, always trying to stay as current as possible in my professional tech stack: Java, Spring, JavaScript, and CSS.  I have taken up a handful of other languages and frameworks to explore how different tools work: Elixir, Phoenix, Scala, Node.js, NoSQL databases, React, and JamStack.  I believe that tested code is the best kind of code and champion Test Driven Development.  I also believe that diverse _and_ inclusive software teams are the way, and have strived to help provide equity in education to under represented people in tech. I have been recognized by GitHub as a [GitHub Campus Advisor](https://education.github.com/teachers/advisors), one of fewer than 300 educators world wide to receive the designation and the only in Columbus, Ohio.
